DIY micro BlockClock with the basic m5stack device

# **INSTRUCTIONS**

Step 1) Follow this guide using [M5Burner](https://github.com/m5stack/m5-docs/blob/master/docs/en/related_documents/M5Burner.md) to flash the UIFlow firmware to your device.

Step 2) Ensure your device is connected to the IDE via WiFi before proceeding. If it is not connected, you will not be able to upload the code and images.

Step 3) Upload the micropython code to the UIFlow IDE. To do this, open the `blockclock_v0.5.py` file in a text editor, and then copy and paste the code into UIFlow under the "Python" tab. 

Step 4) Insert your WiFi SSID beside `wlan_AP =` and your WiFi password beside `wlan_PW =` in the code before flashing the device.

Step 5) Upload the images via the Device File Manager icon near the top right of the IDE. Add them one by one.

Step 6) Click the "Run" icon beside the Device File Manager icon to flash the firmware to your device.
